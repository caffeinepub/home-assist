      "featureTitle": "Replace any lucid, glassmorphism, or frosted-glass background effects on the splash screen with a clean, light background. Use soft, light neutral tones (e.g., off-white, light warm gray, or very light teal tint) with a subtle gradient or gentle texture instead. All overlay panels, cards, and button containers should also use light, opaque or lightly translucent styles — no blurred glass or heavy transparency effects. Ensure text and buttons remain clearly legible against the light background.",
