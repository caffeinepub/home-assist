  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-6 by replacing glassmorphism/frosted-glass effects with a clean light teal-tinted gradient background, removing backdrop-blur, updating all button and panel styles for legibility on a light background, and applying a consistent light theme to the header/footer. All three buttons are preserved with their original labels and emoji. No prohibited files (hooks/ or components/ui) are modified.",
