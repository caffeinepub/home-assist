# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace glassmorphism/frosted-glass effects on the splash screen with a clean, light, subtle background style.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove all glassmorphism, frosted-glass, and backdrop-blur effects from the splash screen background and overlay panels
- Apply a light, soft neutral background (off-white, warm light gray, or very light teal tint) with a subtle gradient or gentle texture
- Update overlay panels, cards, and button containers to use light, opaque or lightly translucent styles (no blurred glass or heavy transparency)
- Ensure header/logo area and footer are styled consistently with the new light theme
- Confirm all buttons ('Take Me Home', 'SOS', 'Other Services') remain clearly legible against the new background

**User-visible outcome:** The splash screen displays a clean, calm, light background with no glassmorphism effects, and all buttons and text remain clearly readable.
